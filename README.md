# oxygenxml.pdfimage
oXygen XML Editor does not render PDF images by default in the Author page, unless you follow the steps described here:
https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/18.1/ug-editor/tasks/installing-pdf-library.html

This plugin represents an alternative to the procedure mentioned above, and it contributes the libraries necessary for enabling oXygen to render PDF images in the Author page. To install it you can choose between the following options:
- copy the `oxygenxml.pdfimage` folder to `OXYGEN_INSTALL_DIR/plugins`;
- install it as an add-on (Oxygen's _Help_ menu > _Install new add-ons_) from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxygenxml/oxygenxml.pdfimage/master/addon.xml.
