This plugin contributes additional libraries which allow the Oxygen XML Editor to render PDF images in the Author page.

This plugin's "oxygenxml.pdfimage" folder can either be copied to the "OXYGEN_INSTALL_DIR\plugins" folder or it can be installed as an add on (Oxygen Help menu->Install new add-on) from the location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxygenxml/oxygenxml.pdfimage/master/addon.xml
